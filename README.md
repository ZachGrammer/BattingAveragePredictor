# Expected Batting Average Leaderboards
This project has two programs. The first program, CleaningTestingAndPredicting, contains the Jupyter Notebook file that I used to clean my data, test which machine-learning model was the most efficient for this project, and make predictions on the data. The second program is a Shiny Application written in R that displays the predictions as two separate customizable leaderboards, a batter one and a pitcher one. Each leaderboard can have a custom amount of minimum at bats or batters faced and allows the user to search for a player.
