# Expected Batting Average Predictor
This project has two programs. The first program, DataCleaningAndTesting, contains the Jupyter Notebook file that I used to clean my data and test which machine-learning model was the most efficient for this project. The second program is a Shiny Application written in Python that allows the user to input a batter's MLBID number and receive what my program expects that player's batting average to be.
